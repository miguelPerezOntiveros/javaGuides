# Chapter 9: I/O and NIO

- Since the Java 7 functionality was added to package names that begin with java.nio, the new name was NIO.2. For the purposes of this chapter and the exam, NIO is shorthand for NIO.2.

### I/O classes you need to understand
- 
	- File - an abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.
	```
	import java.io.*;
	class Writer1 {
		public static void main(String [] args) {
			File file = new File("fileWrite1.txt"); // There's no file (lower f) yet!
		}
	}
	```

	- FileReader
	- BufferedReader
	- FileWriter
	- BufferedWriter
	- PrintWriter
	- Console
