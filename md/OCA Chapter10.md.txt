# Chapter 10: Advanced OO and Design Patterns

### Coupling and Cohesion
- Good OO design calls for loose coupling and high cohesion.
- This facilitates:
	- Ease of creation
	- Ease of maintenance
	- Ease of maintenance

###### Coupling
- Coupling is the degree to which one class knows about another class.
- If the only knowledge that class A has about class B is what class B has exposed through its interface, then class A and class B are said to be loosely coupled.
- If class A knows non-API stuff about class B, and class B knows non-API stuff about class A, then when either class is changed, there's a chance that the other class will break.

###### Cohesion
- Refers to the degree to which a class has a single, well-focused purpose.
- Classes are typically much easier to maintain.
- Classes tend to be more reusable.

### Design patterns

###### Singleton (eager, lazy y en enum)

###### DAO

###### Factory
